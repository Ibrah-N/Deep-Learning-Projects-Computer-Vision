# Computer Vision for Deep Learning - Neuralearn Course

This repository contains projects and notes from my "Computer Vision for Deep Learning" course, 
taken from Neuralearn. The course provided a solid foundation in deep learning concepts and practical 
experience with modern computer vision techniques. Below is an overview of the topics covered and projects I worked on.

## Course Overview

### TensorFlow and Tensors:
- Introduction to TensorFlow and its core concepts.
- Working with tensors, ragged tensors, and performing tensor operations.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
- Deep dive into CNN architecture, covering layers like convolution, pooling, and activation.
- Implemented CNNs for various projects, including image classification and detection tasks.

### Deep Learning Architectures:
- Explored popular deep learning models, including:
  - **LeNet**
  - **MobileNet**
  - **ResNet**
  - **EfficientNet**
  - **VGG**
  - **AlexNet**
- Compared performance and use cases for different architectures.

### Projects:

1. **Car Price Prediction**:  
   - Built and trained a model to predict car prices using regression techniques.

2. **Malaria Disease Classification**:  
   - Data collection, preprocessing, and visualization.
   - Created a deep learning model to classify malaria-infected and healthy cells.
   - Applied techniques to handle overfitting, data augmentation, and used custom layers/models (Keras API, functional, and subclassing).

3. **Human Emotion Detection**:  
   - Developed a deep learning model to detect human emotions from images.
   - Techniques included transfer learning, fine-tuning, and Hugging Face transformer tuning.
   - Performed black-box testing (visualizing convolution layers) and white-box testing (comparing predictions with original samples).

### Transformers:
- Explored transformer models for tasks like image classification and generation.
- Implemented fine-tuning for specific applications using pre-trained transformer models.

### MLOps:
- Focused on managing machine learning workflows with:
  - Dataset and model versioning.
  - Experiment tracking using **Wandb**.
  - Model testing and deployment on the cloud.

### Quantization:
- Explored post-training quantization and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) for optimizing model performance on edge devices.

### YOLO v2 (You Only Look Once) Architecture:
- Theoretical and practical exploration of the YOLO v2 object detection architecture.
- Implemented custom loss functions, Non-Max Suppression, and Intersection over Union (IoU).

### Image Generation and Generative Models:
- Studied image generation techniques using:
  - **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)**
  - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
- Projects included generating handwritten digits (MNIST) with VAE and generating realistic celebrity faces using **DCGAN** and the CelebA dataset.

## Key Learnings
This course provided in-depth knowledge in both foundational and advanced computer vision topics, allowing me to apply theoretical concepts through hands-on projects. I gained experience with real-world workflows in machine learning, from data collection and model building to deployment and MLOps.
